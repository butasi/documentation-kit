# atmega328p
The Atmel ® ATmega328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR® enhanced RISC architecture. By
executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega328P achieves throughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz
allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed
